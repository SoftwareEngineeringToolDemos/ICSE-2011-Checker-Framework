Installation
Requirements:

This plugin has been tested on both Eclipse 3.7.2 and 4.2.1 using Java 7.

Your Eclipse installation MUST be running on a Java 7 VM or newer. To see what Java VM is being used by Eclipse, select from the menu Help ‑> About Eclipse Platform ‑> Installation Details. Depending on your OS/Eclipse version, the menu may be Help ‑> About Eclipse SDK ‑> Installation Details.

Furthermore, until Java 8 is release and officially supported by Eclipse we suggest that all Checker Framework annotations be written in the comments. This will avoid many text highlighting errors with versions of Eclipse that don't support the new JSR308 syntax changes.


Instructions

1.Open Eclipse and select from menus: Help ‑> Install New Software...
2.Click Add.
3.Enter the following:
    Name: 	Checker Framework
    Location: 	http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/eclipse
Click OK.
4.Appearing under name should be "Pluggable Type-Checking", check the box next to it.
5.Click Next.
6.A summary of the plugins to be installed will be displayed. Under Name should appear "Checker Framework Feature" followed by the version of the plugin being installed. Click Next again.
7.Accept the license agreement and click Finish.
8.The plugin will begin installing. The plugin is NOT digitally signed. Install it anyway.
9.Click "Restart Now".

Note: You may want to add checker-qual.jar to your classpath for each Eclipse project you wish to check. It provides the annotations used by the Checker Framework for its built-in type checkers.
To add the checker-qual.jar to your Eclipse project, download the jar from the above link. Then right click the project you wish to check and select Properties -> Java Build Path -> Libraries -> Add External Jars. Select checker-qual.jar from the directory in which it's saved.
